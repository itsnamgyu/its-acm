# its-algo

This is how I study for Sogang University course, "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" (CSE3081) by professor Insung Ihm, and "Foundations of Algorithms 5th Edition" by Richard E. Neapolitan!

# Main Points
1. Review data structures
2. Understand major methodologies through common algorithms
3. Implement them > check understanding, improve intuition, explore implementation details (like edge-cases)
    - Practice basic algorithms to second-nature-level (like bsearch)
4. Intermediate algorithm time complexity analysis (outside of Github)
5. Intermediate algorithm proof (outside of Github)
